## What are dotfiles? {.smaller}

* Dotfiles are personal configuration files that lie in your home directory.
* They are named as such because they typically either
  * Have filenames beginning with a "`.`".
  * Live in a subdirectory of your home directory that begins with a "`.`".
* Of course this means they are hidden on Unix-like systems.

### Examples {.smaller}

Some common examples you might have come across:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}
* `~/.bashrc`
* `~/.ssh/config`[^*]
:::

::: {.column width="70%"}
* `~/.vimrc` or `~/.emacs`
* `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config`
:::

::::

[^*]: It's wise to not make this file public _and_ unencrypted.

## Why manage your dotfiles?

* Over time you might customize these configuration files to best suit your
workflow, aesthetics and preferences.
* Managing your dotfiles using version control and remote repository hosting
has many of the same benefits as doing so for other code:
  * Backups.
  * Makes it simpler to determine and revert breaking changes.
  * History can add context to why a file is the way it is.
* The main additional benefit is making it [**much
  easier**]{style="color:orange;"} to move your configuration to a new machine.

## Frameworks/Tools

There are many frameworks/tools to help you manage your dotfiles:

  machines
  * Integration with password managers to store and recover secrets
  * Full file encryption (using gpg or age)
  * Ability to run scripts (once or every time you apply)
* Installation is easy:
  * Runs on all popular OSs and architectures
  * Distributed as a single statically-linked binary with no external
  dependencies
  * Does not require root access
