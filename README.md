# Managing your dotfiles (2024-10-08)

This repository contains the code to generate the slides for the internal
[Cambridge RCS](https://www.hpc.cam.ac.uk/) seminar delivered by
[Miren Radia](https://github.com/mirenradia/) and [Jack
Atkinson](https://github.com/jatkinson1000) on Tue 08 Oct 2024.

## Quarto

These slides are written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) markdown in the
[Reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) format.

### Build

To generate the slides, [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
and then execute

```
quarto render dotfiles.qmd
```

It should generate a `dotfiles.html` file which you can open with a web browser.
